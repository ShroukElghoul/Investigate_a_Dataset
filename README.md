# Investigate_a_Dataset
## Project Overview
This project is part of Udacity Advanced Data Analysis Track Nanodegree. It is to analyze a dataset and then communicate the findings about it. Python libraries used are NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib for easier analysis.

## The Dataset
The data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb), including user ratings and revenue.<br/> 
<br/>
   ● Certain columns, like ‘cast’ and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.<br/> 
   ● There are some odd characters in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.<br/> 
   ● The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.<br/> 
<br/>
   ● Features:
   (id, imdb_id, popularity, budget, revenue, original_title, cast, homepage, director, tagline, keywords, overview, runtime, genres, production_companies, release_date, vote_count, vote_average, release_year, budget_adj, revenue_adj)
   
## Local Environment Installation Guide
You will need an installation of Python3, plus the following libraries:<br/>
   ● pandas<br/>
   ● NumPy<br/>
   ● Matplotlib<br/>
   ● csv<br/>
You can Download the script and the dataset and run it on Python IDE or jupyter Notebook<br/>
## Project Learning Outcomes
● Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process<br/>
● Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions<br/>
● Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use<br/>
● Have experience communicating the results of your analysis<br/>
● Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code<br/>
● Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently<br/>
● Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings<br/>
